🎙️🧠 GemVoice – An AI-Powered Voice Assistant using Google Gemini

GemVoice is a voice-controlled desktop assistant built using Python and powered by Google Gemini AI. It enables hands-free interaction by understanding spoken commands, performing automation tasks, retrieving real-time information, and generating intelligent conversational responses.

The assistant runs locally and communicates entirely through voice for a smooth and intuitive user experience.

🔍 Overview

GemVoice functions as a smart personal assistant designed for desktop environments. It listens for voice commands, analyzes user intent using Python logic and AI models, and responds through natural-sounding speech.

The project combines voice recognition, AI-driven reasoning, and system automation into a single modular application.
