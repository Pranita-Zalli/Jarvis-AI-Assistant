📰 News Reading
- Fetches top headlines using News API
- Reads news aloud on command
- `stop` → stops speech immediately

🌦 Weather Information
- Command: `tell me weather`
- Prompts for city name
- If recognized → provides city-specific weather
- If not recognized → defaults to current location and announces:  
  “Speech not recognized. Using current location.”

⏰ Alarm / Clock Access
- Command: `open alarm`
- Opens the system clock or alarm application

💬 WhatsApp Automation
- Command: `open whatsapp`
- Requests phone number via voice
- Opens WhatsApp chat with the specified number
